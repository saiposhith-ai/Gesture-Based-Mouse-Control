# Gesture-Based Mouse Control

This project enables hands-free control of a computer mouse using hand gestures, leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. It tracks hand movements through a webcam and maps them to cursor actions such as movement, clicking, and scrolling.

## Features
- **Cursor Control:** Move the mouse by moving your index finger.
- **Click Gesture:** Pinch thumb and index finger together to perform a click.
- **Scroll Gesture:** Move the index and middle fingers up/down together to scroll.
- **Smooth Movement:** Cursor movement is smoothed for a better user experience.
